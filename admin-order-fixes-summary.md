# Admin Order Management Fixes

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. Status Update Sync Problem
**Problem**: When changing order status in the OrderDetails modal, the change wasn't reflected in the main order list outside.

**Solution**:
- Added `onStatusUpdate` callback prop to `OrderDetails` component
- Created `handleStatusUpdateFromModal` function in `OrdersTable` to update local state
- Added success notifications with proper French text and emojis
- Ensured proper TypeScript typing for status updates

### 2. Mobile-Unfriendly Action Buttons
**Problem**: Quick action buttons were too small and cramped on mobile devices.

**Solution**:
- Increased button heights to minimum 48px for better touch targets
- Changed layout from 2-column to 1-column on mobile (`grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2`)
- Added proper spacing (`gap-3` instead of `gap-2`)
- Improved typography with larger text (`text-base`)
- Added `touch-action: manipulation` for better mobile performance
- Enhanced borders and padding for better visual clarity

## 📱 Mobile Optimizations

### Action Buttons
- **Minimum height**: 48px (Apple/Google recommended touch target)
- **Better spacing**: 12px gaps between elements
- **Larger fonts**: Base size (16px) for better readability
- **Touch optimization**: Disabled tap highlights and improved touch response

### Status Dropdown
- **Full-width design** on mobile
- **Better positioned overlay** that adapts to screen size
- **Improved z-index management** for proper layering
- **Smart positioning** that prevents dropdown from going off-screen

### CSS Enhancements
- Added `.order-card-actions` class for consistent touch behavior
- Improved button specifications in global CSS
- Enhanced mobile responsiveness across admin interface
