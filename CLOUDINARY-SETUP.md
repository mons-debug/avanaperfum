# 🌤️ Cloudinary Setup Guide for AVANA PARFUM

## Overview
This guide will help you set up Cloudinary for image uploads in your AVANA PARFUM application. Cloudinary is a cloud-based image and video management service that works perfectly with deployment platforms like Vercel, Netlify, etc.

## 🚀 Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Create a Cloudinary Account
1. Go to [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email address

### 2. Get Your Cloudinary Credentials
1. Log in to your Cloudinary dashboard
2. Go to the **Dashboard** tab
3. You'll see your credentials:
   - **Cloud Name** (e.g., `dw1234567`)
   - **API Key** (e.g., `123456789012345`)
   - **API Secret** (e.g., `abcDEF123ghiJKL456`)

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

#### For Local Development:
Update your `.env.local` file:
```env
# Cloudinary Configuration for Image Uploads
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_actual_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_actual_api_secret
```

#### For Production Deployment:
Add these environment variables to your deployment platform:

**Vercel:**
1. Go to your project dashboard on Vercel
2. Go to Settings → Environment Variables
3. Add the three Cloudinary variables

**Netlify:**
1. Go to Site settings → Environment variables
2. Add the three Cloudinary variables

**Railway/Render:**

2. Add the environment variables

### 4. Test the Setup
1. Save your environment variables
2. Restart your development server: `npm run dev`
3. Go to any product edit page in your admin panel
4. Try uploading an image
5. You should see successful uploads to Cloudinary

## 🔧 What the Integration Does

### Image Processing

- **Resizing**: Images are resized to max 800x800 pixels
- **Quality**: Auto-quality setting for best performance
- **Format**: Supports JPG, PNG, WEBP formats

### Organization
- **Folder structure**: All images are stored in `avana-products/` folder

## 📱 Free Plan Limitations
Cloudinary's free plan includes:

This is more than enough for most small to medium e-commerce sites.

## 🔒 Security Best Practices
1. **Never commit** your API secret to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for all credentials

- ✅ Images load fast on your website
- ✅ No "Failed to upload image" errors

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Error: "Cloudinary configuration missing"
- Check that all three environment variables are set
- Restart your development server after adding variables
- For production: redeploy after adding environment variables

### Error: "Invalid credentials"
- Double-check your credentials in Cloudinary dashboard
- Make sure there are no extra spaces in environment variables
- API Secret should be kept private and secure

### Images not appearing
- Check browser network tab for 404 errors
- Verify the image URLs in Cloudinary dashboard
- Clear browser cache

## 🎉 Next Steps
Once Cloudinary is set up:
1. Test uploading images in admin panel
2. Check that images appear in product listings
3. Verify images load correctly on product pages
4. Deploy to production and test there
